## Version 5.0.2, 17th of October 2019

* Namespace support for MS SQL Server databases. This fixes a severe error making it impossible to CRUDify any SQL Server database that is not in the default namespace (_"dbo"_).

* New slot called __[strings.join]__ that allows you to join multiple strings together with a separating character.

* Better handling of folders when an SQL Server database is CRUDified, among other things, a separate folder for each namespace will be automatically created. Maintaining the namespace your database is already declared with.



## Version 5.0.3, future release

* Support for invoking async slots through __[slots.signal]__

* Displaying version number of core backend in the _"ping"_ endpoint.

* Started working on validators, to validate input. These can be found in the project magic.lambda.validators.
