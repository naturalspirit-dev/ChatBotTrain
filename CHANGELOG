## Version 5.2, 17th of October 2019

* Namespace support for MS SQL Server databases. This fixes a severe error making it impossible to CRUDify any SQL Server database that is not in the default namespace (_"dbo"_).

* New slot called __[strings.join]__ that allows you to join multiple strings together with a separating character.

* Better handling of folders when an SQL Server database is CRUDified, among other things, a separate folder for each namespace will be automatically created. Maintaining the namespace your database is already declared with.



## Version 5.3, 20th of October 2019

* Support for invoking async slots through __[slots.signal]__

* Displaying version number of core backend in the _"ping"_ endpoint.

* Started working on validators, to validate input. These can be found in the project magic.lambda.validators.



## Version 5.4

* Support for _"create"_ CRUD endpoints where the database table does _not_ implement some sort of automatically generated ID.

* Displaying the version of the backend in the frontend, but only if logged in as root.

* Logging warning to console if the _"auth secret"_ has not been changed from its default value.

* Allowing the frontend to override its backend URL, to support maintaining multiple backends form the same frontend dashboard.



## Version 5.5

* Fixing a bug that prevented _"limit"_ and _"offset"_ criteria to function.

* Fixing a bug that prevented limit and offset from working in MySQL CRUDified endpoints.

* Fixed an error with [wait.io.file.save] that didn't overwrite the existing file, if the existing file was longer than its new content.
