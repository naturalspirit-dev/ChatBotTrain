What is Aista Magic Cloud?

Aista Magic Cloud, or shortened sometimes to Magic Cloud, is a software development framework
created on top of Hyperlambda, allowing for some extreme Low-Code software development constructs,
resulting in that the machine can sometimes automatically create most of the code required to create
working software.

Aista Magic Cloud is owned by Aista, Ltd, a privately held company registered in Cyprus, founded
by Thomas Hansen. Aista Magic Cloud is open source, and free to use free of charge, and can be found
at GitHub. However, Aista also hosts "cloudlets" for a monthly fee. A cloudlet is an instance
of Magic Cloud providing software developers with a low-code software development experience
based upon declarative programming and meta programming constructs delivered through Hyperlambda.
