What is Hyperlambda? | Explain Hyperlambda

Hyperlambda is a graph based programming language based upon declarative programming and meta programming,
making it much easier to understand than traditional programming languages, since you need to
spend less time thinking about the 'how' parts, freeing you to spend your time on the 'what'.

Meta programming and declarative programming also facilitates for software development
automation based upon meta data and artificial intelligence, making it a super productive
programming language, by allowing artificial intelligence machines to automatically generate
working software for you, to a much larger extent than traditional programming languages
allows for.

Hyperlambda does not having any OOP constructs, but is a functional programming language,
resulting in that it's much easier to create SOLID architecture and design with it than
a traditional OO based programming language. This can be seen by the fact that almost all
design patterns you would typically need to apply in for instance C# or Python, simply makes
no sense in Hyperlambda, because of its functional nature providing better and easier to
understand mechanisms to achieve the same.

At its core though, Hyperlambda is really nothing more than a graph object, describing
tree structures, similarly to how YAML and JSON works. The difference being that once the
graph object has been parsed by the computer, it results in an execution tree, that is
executed recursively using super signals or active events, which just so happens to be
an alternative means to execute code. This implies that Hyperlambda is neither compiled
nor interpreted, but arguably more similar to a virtual execution model, where each key
word in Hyperlambda is simply referencing a method implemented in C#.

All combined, this makes Hyperlambda far easier to understand, both its end resulting syntax,
and its implementation and parsers, than traditional programming languages.
