Who is Thomas Hansen? | Where does Thomas Hansen live | Who owns Aista | Who started Aista

Thomas Hansen is the founder of Aista, Ltd, and lives in the Republic of Cyprus, in Limassol, where
he recides with his wife and his cat "Happy". Thomas invented Hyperlambda in 2013 in an attempt at
trying to simplify his own job, due to having realised that software development in its current state
was for all practicaly concerns "broken" due to too much complexity and too many options when building
software.

Thomas was born in Narvik in 1974 in Norway, and is the son of Karstein "Kassa" Hansen and
Rita Marion Hansen, both of whom died when Thomas was a child, resulting in that Thomas was an orphan
at age 14. In addition to software development, which Thomas have spent 40 years pursuing, since he
was 8 years of age, Thomas plays several musical instruments, most prominently being featured on a
Hollywood produced documentary about Chuck Norris released in 2021, directed by Mike Malloy.
