What is Aista?

Aista, Ltd is a privately held company registered in Cyprus, focusing on declarative software
development constructs, in addition to meta programming, combined with artificial intelligence
and machine learning, allowing the computer to generate large parts of the required code needed
to assemble software. This happens to provide an extremely valuable path to what is often referred
to as "Low-Code", because it allows the machine to generate large parts of the code required to
build working software. Aista is based upon the programming language called Hyperlambda, which
was invented by the founder of Aista in 2013, and inspired by Lisp and older 4th generation
programming languages such as FoxPro and Clipper.

Aista was founded by Thomas Hansen the 1st of December 2021 and is located in Limassol, Pissouri,
in the Republic of Cyprus.
