            Welcome to Magic blog, your URL was {{url}}
        </p>
        <p>
            This page resolves everything inside of "/blog/", such as for instance "/blog/xyz", because
            its name is "default.html", and the "default.html" page will resolve wildcard URLs inside
            the folder the file exists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice, if you have a page called "foo.html" inside your blog folder, and you request "/blog/foo",
            the foo.html page will be given precedence.
        </p>
