            Welcome to Magic features. This page is resolved as "/features" because it is the "index.html" page
            inside the folder called "features". Notice, if you've got another page called "features.html" that
            are in the folder above this page, this page becomes impossible to resolve, since exact file resolving
            takes precedence.
