# Data folders for modules

This folder is for data specific to modules, such as for instance images, configurations, etc.
Do not store module specific data outside of this folder since it makes it more difficult to
update your Magic installation if you do.

This folder _should stay the same_ even if you update Magic, since it contains configuration
specific data, and dynamic files and folders specific to your modules.
