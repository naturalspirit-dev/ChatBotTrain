# Default Angular frontend template

This is the default Angular template, that comes out of the box with Magic. It creates an Angular frontend for
you, with a Material side navigator to the left, and one router link for each of your CRUD read endpoints. It
generates one component and router link for each of your database tables. The CRUD components it creates, will
be built using an Angular Material table, and have support for sorting, paging and filtering. In addition it
will support inserting, updating and deleting existing items. Inserting and updating is done through a modal
Angular Material dialog.
