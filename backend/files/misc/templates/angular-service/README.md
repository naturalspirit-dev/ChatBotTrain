# Angular HTTP Service template

This template will *only* generate an HTTP service layer for you, with some helper
functionality, such as automatically injecting your JWT token if authenticated as
an HTTP Bearer Authorization token into your requests towards your backend.

In addition the template will (of course) generate an HTTP service method for
all your CRUD endpoints in your backend.

The project will not generate any GUI, besides a default (more or less empty)
app.component file, allowing you to play around with authentication and such
as you see fit.
