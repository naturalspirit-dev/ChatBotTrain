# Main Bazar folder

This folder contains your Bazar applications, and your Bazar manifest, specifically for apps
you have published yourself, that others can easily install into their Magic installation.
If you run the _"release-bazar"_ macro in Hyper IDE, this will package a Bazar app for you
automatically, and expose the application through your local Bazar, allowing others to download
the app and install it in their local Magic server.
