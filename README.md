# Magic, an Application Generator and Cloud System

Magic is an application generator, that allows you to create CRUD apps automatically. In addition it
is a complete Open Source cloud system, allowing you to create your own virtualised cloud on top
of your own server, and/or other cloud systems. Below is a screenshot of its dashboard.

## License
The frontend dashboard is licensed under the terms of the GPL version 3, as published by the Free Software Foundation,
while the backend is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. What this implies, is that you can freely use Magic
as you see fit, also in your own proprietary and closed source applications - However, if you modify any of its plugins,
and or the dashboard frontend, you'll have to publish your changes to anyone requesting your changes. To sum up
what this implies in a _"dumbed down"_ explanation, here's the explanation by component.

* You can use Magic to create closed source applications, and extend it with custom C# code, without having to publish your extensions
* You can use Magic to scaffold frontend applications that are closed source
* If you improve upon Magic's plugins, or the frontend dashboard, you'll need to publish your changes

To sum up each license.

* All NuGet packages are LGPL3
* The `backend` folder is MIT
* The `frontend` folder is GPL3

See the enclosed LICENSE files within each folder, and/or plugin if in doubt.
