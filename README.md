# Magic, create your next ASP.NET Core web API in 5 minutes

Magic is a starter kit for your ASP.NET Core web APIs, that brings the ideas of DRY (_"Don't Repeat Yourself"_) to an extreme level.
If you follow a small recipe as you create your controller endpoints, services, view models, and database models, you will literally
start out with 80% of your job done. The project is hence in such a way a template for your own projects, allowing you to _"hit the ground
running"_ as you start out your next project. Magic is best suited for database applications, where you need to wrap your database tables,
and present these to some client, using an HTTP REST API. Basically, for all your CRUD needs, all you need to do to create your Magic wrapper,
is to create a service, a contract (service interface), a controller, and declare your models (view model and database model). After
you have correctly declared these types, Magic simply takes care of the rest for you automagically.

Out of the box Magic is a simple HTTP REST TODO web api, but this is only there to serve as an example. Remove the existing TODO projects,
and replace them with your own domain types, and you'll hit the ground running. All parts of your application can easily be modified, extended
or changed, by simply overriding that which you need to override. In such a way Magic provides you with a consistent API, allowing you to
extend and modify that which you need to modify, and having the rest done automagically for you through the powers of Magic.
