# Magic, a starter kit for your next ASP.NET Core web APIs

Magic is a starter kit for your ASP.NET Core web APIs, that brings the ideas of DRY (_"Don't Repeat Yourself"_) to an extreme level.
If you follow a small recipe as you create your controller endpoints, services, view models, and database modelds, you will literally
start out with 80% of your job done. The project is hence in such a way a template for your own projects, allowing you to _"hit the ground
running"_ as you start out your next project.
