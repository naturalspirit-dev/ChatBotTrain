# Magic for ASP.NET Core

Magic is a starter kit for super dynamic and super DRY ASP.NET Core web API applications. Among other things, it allows you to _"declare"_
a web API endpoint, with a handful of Hyperlambda lines of code. Hyperlambda is kind of like YAML, only significantly simpler in its syntax.
Your Hyperlambda is again invoking C# methods, using a Super Signal design pattern, allowing you to make solutions that are unimaginably
loosely coupled together, resulting in super dynamic and flexible web APIs.

It was build by leveraging the ideas written about in the following MSDN article to the extreme. However, the library has been completely
changed since the article was written, and improved to become unrecognizable due to chasing these same ideas further and further down
the rabbit hole.

Magic is licensed as Affero GPL. If this is a problem, you can contact at thomas@gaiasoul.com me to negotiate a proprietary license if
you want to use the framework to build closed source code.

**NOTICE**

After refactoring Magic to use Hyperlambda, the library has not yet been completely stabilized and should be considered BETA software at
the moment - At least until I manage to create a release of its current codebase.
