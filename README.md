# A lowcode CRUD generator - No code required

![Build status](https://github.com/polterguy/magic/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)

Magic is a nocode/lowcode CRUD generator that allows you to generate CRUD apps 100% automatically.
In addition it is a complete open source cloud platform and IDE, allowing you to create your own virtualized
cloud on top of your own server, and/or other cloud systems, editing your code from your phone if required.
Magic is professionally maintained by [Aista](https://aista.com).
Below is a screenshot of an app built in 5 minutes using our [nocode CRUD generator](https://aista.com/crud-datagrid/).

Magic works by reading meta data from your database, for then to automatically generate a
complete backend nocode CRUD API for you. The resuling CRUD API is secured automatically, and Magic takes care
of authentication, authorisation, user management, and everything else that's difficult. Afterwards you can
optionally generate a CRUD datagrid giving you a full stack web app as the screenshot above illustrates.
