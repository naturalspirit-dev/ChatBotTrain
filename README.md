# Magic for ASP.NET

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic)

Magic is a CRUD app generator, allowing you to create CRUD Web APIs on top of ASP.NET Core.
In 1 minute, you can basically create hundreds of HTTP REST based CRUD Web API endpoints,
wrapping your entire database, even if it has hundreds of tables. It feels almost like Magic,
allowing you to build secure CRUD Web API endpoints in seconds, hence its name. Watch the video
below for a demonstration of the system.

It was build by leveraging the ideas written about in the following MSDN article to the extreme. However, the library has been completely
changed since the article was written, and improved to become unrecognizable due to chasing these same ideas further and further down
the rabbit hole.

The above article is written by me, the developer behind Magic. In addition I also wrote the 5th most read article
for MSDN Magazine about [Hyperlambda, making C# more dynamic](https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/mt809119).
Although the article is a bit dated today, it explains some of the techniques that has been applied
when creating Magic.

## License

Although most of Magic's source code is publicly available, Magic is _not_ Open Source or Free Software.
You have to obtain a valid license key to install it in production, and I normally charge a fee for such a
key. You can [obtain a license key here](https://gaiasoul.com/license-magic/).
Notice, 5 hours after you put Magic into production, it will stop functioning, unless you have a valid
license for it.
