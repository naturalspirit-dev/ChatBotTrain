# A low-code CRUD generator

![Build status](https://github.com/polterguy/magic/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)

Magic is a no-code/low-code CRUD generator that allows you to generate CRUD apps 100% automatically.
In addition it is a complete open source cloud platform and IDE, allowing you to create your own virtualized
cloud on top of your own server, and/or other cloud systems, editing your code from your phone if required.
Below is a screenshot of Hyper IDE.

Magic works by reading meta data from your database, for then to automatically generate a
complete backend web API for you. The resuling CRUD API is secured automatically, and Magic takes care
of authentication, authorisation, user management, and everything else that's difficult.
