# Default Angular frontend template

This folder contains your default Angular template, used during scaffolding your endpoints. It creates an Angular frontend for
you, with a Material side navigator to the left, a material table, and one component for each of your CRUD read endpoints.

In addition, it allows you to delete, update and create records. Creating records, and updating them, will open up a modal
dialog, allowing you to edit your entity's fields. This template is highly responsive in nature, and will shrink/grow the
number of visible columns, according to how wide your browser surface is. It also allows you to page, sort and filter your items
in its material datagrid/table.

This template also contains an authentication/authorization component, allowing you to edit users/roles in your system - In
addition to a _"change my password"_ component, from where a user can change his existing password if he wants to.
