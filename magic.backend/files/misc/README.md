# Your misc folder

This folder contains your miscelanous files, such as helper SQL scripts to create example databases, etc - In addition to
snippets files for MySQL and MS SQL, and other helper files. Although this folder is not protected, you should be careful
with it, and among other things not delete your mssql or mysql folders, since the SQL evaluator depends upon that these
folders exists, in order to load and store snippets for you.
