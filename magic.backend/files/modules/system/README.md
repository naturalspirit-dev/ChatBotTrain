# System endpoints

These are system endpoints, required to make parts of the system function correctly. For instance, the meta
data information parts of Magic, that returns information about endpoints, can be found in here. The
endpoint that allows you to evaluated Hyperlambda can also be found in here.

In addition, some CRUD helper slots are created inside of the _"magic.startup"_ folder inside of
this folder.
