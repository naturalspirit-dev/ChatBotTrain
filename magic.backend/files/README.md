# Files for your installation

In here you can find the files that you have for some reasons created, uploaded, etc into
your installation. This serves by default as the _"root folder"_ for any files you upload.

This folder also serves as the root folder for your dynamically created Hyperlambda modules,
that you can find in the _"modules"_ folder.
