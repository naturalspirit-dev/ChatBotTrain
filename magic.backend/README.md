# Magic backend

This is your actual web API application. Its purpose is to serve as a _"host"_ for your own application, that you can build
either in C# using for instance the _"modules/magic.io"_ module as an example, or in Hyperlambda using the _"magic.backend/files/modules/todo"
folder as an example of, and/or any combination of Hyperlambda/C# that your particular solution happens to require.
