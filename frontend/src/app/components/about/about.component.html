  <h2>About Magic Cloud</h2>

  <img class="me" src="/assets/thomas.jpeg" alt="Yours truly">
  <p>
    Magic Cloud is in its entirety created by me (Thomas Hansen), and is 100% Open Source and free to use, also in
    proprietary/commercial projects. Magic consists of years of innovation and work, and is constantly maintained
    by yours truly in my spare time.
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="!payPalConfig">
    It looks like you are an active supported of Magic Cloud. Thank you for appreciating my work. If you need help
    with something feel free to reach out to me on <a href="mailto:thomas@servergardens.com">thomas@servergardens.com</a>,
    and I will help you as best I can. In fact, your existing donation has just ensured you 30 minutes of setup help
    with Magic, using a screen share program such as Skype or Zoom if you should need it. Or you can send me an email
    describing your problem and I will try to solve it as best I can within 30 minutes of my time.
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="payPalConfig">
    However, in order for me to create the best possible product for you, I am dependent upon your willingness to donate,
    such that I can justify spending time on the project. Simply because creating and maintaining Magic is an insane
    amount of work, and we all need to feed our families.
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="payPalConfig">
    If you got value from Magic, I would appreciate a donation from you. This justifies me continuing working on the
    project, ensuring you get the best possible value out of it. Click the button below to donate to me. Notice, I am
    also available for hire in my spare time to create modules for Magic, and or help you getting started with Magic.
    If you're interested in this, you can <a href="mailto:thomas@servergardens.com">send me an email</a> and ask for a
    quote. I am also available for screen shares over Skype, Zoom, or similar platforms to help you getting started
    with Magic - For a fee, paid in full before I help you. For the record, if you should choose to donate, this page
    will automagically disappear, and I will not ask you for a donation again, and your donation will make you eligible
    for 30 minutes of setup help.
