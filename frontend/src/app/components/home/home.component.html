  <h1>Magic Privacy Cloud</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to Magic Privacy Cloud, a cloud system allowing you to host your own cloud,
    while still getting most features from hosted cloud systems, such as Azure and
    AWS, in addition to some additional features, such as the ability to create web apps
    by simply clicking a button. Magic gives you almost everything a hosted
    cloud vendor provides you with - Only for a fraction of the cost. And you can host it
    out of your own living room if you wish.

    And you have 100% privacy and freedom from censorship.
