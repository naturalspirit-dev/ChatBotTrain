    Magic is an Open Source and Free Software CRUD backend build in ASP.NET Core. Its purpose is to
    allow you to <em>"magically"</em> do the boring stuff, by using automation techniques, creating
    80% of your CRUD endpoints, automatically wrapping your MySQL or MSSQL database - While leaving
    the fun stuff left for you to implement yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Magic is Open Source and Free Software, but licensed under the Affero GPL license, which implies
    that you have to create Open Source software yourself to use it for free. If this is not an option
    for you, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:thomas@gaiasoul.com">thomas@gaiasoul.com</a>
    and negotiate the purchasing of a proprietary license from me.
