  <h1>Magic Cloud {{version}}</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to Magic Cloud, a virtual cloud system, fifth generation programming language,
    and application generator allowing your computer to create most of your code.
    To get started, click the question mark in the top right corner of this page, and watch the
    YouTube video, that will walk you through how to configure Magic initially.
    Each menu item will show a context sensitive tutorial video as you click the question mark,
    explaining the basic features for that particular page. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Notice</strong> - As of version 9.0.0 Magic is 100% Open Source through to the bone,
    and I no longer charge for use of Magic. And you can create as many closed source applications
    using Magic as you wish. The only restriction is if you improve upon the Angular frontend dashboard,
    and/or improve upon the NuGet packages, at which point you'll need to publish your changes.
