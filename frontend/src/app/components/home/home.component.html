  <p>
    Magic is an automation framework built in ASP.NET Core. Its purpose is to
    allow you to <em>"magically"</em> do the boring stuff, by using automation techniques.
    It features among other things an HTTP Web API REST CRUD scaffolder, that will
    automatically create CRUD endpoints wrapping your MySQL or MS SQL Server database.

  <p>
    Although most of its source code is publicly available for academic reasons, Magic is
    not Open Source or Free Software - We do charge a fee for each server/hostname/DNS-record
    you want to run Magic on. Evaluating Magic and using it on your local development machine
    is free however. We also might give you a free license key, if you want
    to use Magic to create Free and Open Source Software.
