  <p>
    Magic is a CRUD backend generator built in ASP.NET Core. Its purpose is to
    allow you to <em>"magically"</em> do the boring stuff, by using automation techniques, creating
    80% of your CRUD endpoints, automatically wrapping your MySQL or MS SQL Server database - 
    While you get to focus on the fun stuff.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although most of its source code is publicly available for academic reasons, Magic is
    not Open Source or Free Software - We do charge a fee for each server/hostname/DNS-record
    you want to run Magic on. Evaluating Magic and using it on your local development machine
    is free however. We also might give you a free license key, if you want
    to use Magic to create Free and Open Source Software.
